--
-- The result of this function is a nested monadic value to give more
-- fine-grained control/separation between the start of listening for messages
-- and the start of processing. The inner action folds the actual messages and
-- completes when the channel is closed and exhausted. The outer action
-- controls from when on messages are received. Specifically:
--
--  ['BroadcastChan' v'In':]:
--
--      Will process all messages sent after the outer action completes.
--
--  ['BroadcastChan' v'Out':]:
--
--      Will process all messages that are unread when the outer action
--      completes, as well as all future messages.
--
--      After the outer action completes the fold is unaffected by other
--      (concurrent) reads performed on the original channel. So it's safe to
--      reuse the channel.
